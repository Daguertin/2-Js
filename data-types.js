        ex. if you add 2+2 you get for... but if you add 2+"2" you get 22

    Modulo ---> remainder of long division
    console.log(10 / 2); (to figure out if it goes in perfectly do)
    console.log(10 % 2); (it says 0 because it returns the amount)

    Assignment Operator 
    let myName = "Dan" //assigns value of dan to the variable (myName)
    console.log(myName)cl

    Comparison
    console.log(myName == "Dan") (True) (double)

    strict comparison
    console.log (678 === "678") (false) (triple)

    Is not equal to -> Flips values
    console.log(2=2)true, console.log(2!=2)false (returns false even though true)
    console.log(2!==2)returns false (flips the value)

        console.log("No name");}
